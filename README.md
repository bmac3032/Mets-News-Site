<h1>Welcome to Let's Go Mets, a news application for all things New York Mets!</h1>
<hr />
<p>This is a simple website that showcases the latest news and updates about the New York Mets, a professional baseball team from the MLB</p>
<p>It has articles, daily lineups, roster information, trade rumors, contract information, player stats, and so much more.</p>

<h2>This site is a work in progress</h2>

<p>This project is still undergoing work, and is lacking many features.</p>
<p>Currently it only has a Home, about, and Players page. The players page will display a small card for each player, and then clicking on a card will show a dedicated page for that player will detailed information and statistics. This feature is in being implemented.</p>

<h3>Tech Stack Used</h3>

<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap 4.</p>
<p>Will eventually use Next.js to help post new articles and news stories about the team.</p>

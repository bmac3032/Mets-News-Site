Welcome to Let's Go Mets, a news application for all things New York Mets!
This is a simple website that showcases the latest news and updates about the New York Mets, a professional baseball team from the MLB

It has articles, daily lineups, roster information, trade rumors, contract information, player stats, and so much more.

This site is a work in progress
This project is still undergoing work, and is lacking many features.

Currently it only has a Home, about, and Players page. The players page will display a small card for each player, and then clicking on a card will show a dedicated page for that player will detailed information and statistics. This feature is in being implemented.

Tech Stack Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap 4.

Will eventually use Next.js to help post new articles and news stories about the team.
